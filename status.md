#### Project title

Discord Message Scraper/Cloner

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Most of my work so far has been researching how to implement discord bots, I feel I have a good understanding of how to get the messages from discord using my account as a selfbot.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to figure out how to use an actual discord bot through discord to display my messages in a nicely formatted way.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It seems as though rate limiting, and discord flagging my account as 'suspicious' will be a problem in progressing and improving my bot. 
Through my research I have found that self bots are allowed on discord, but I need to do more research to make sure the final version of my bot is not breaking discords TOS.
I would like to run these tests on my main account, but because the Github Repository is public, I would have to expose my discord authentication token which could potentially be harmful for me. Because of this I had to make a new discord, which was immediately flagged after making some requests. I'm going to attempt further tests with one of my older throwaway discords to see if it gives me less problems.

####
P.S. For some reason my commits on VScode are coming through from my other older github account, and I cannot figure out how to fix this.
